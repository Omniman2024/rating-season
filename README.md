##  Dataset

**File:** `imdb_top_250_series_episode_ratings(1).csv`

This dataset is available in kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wittmannf/episode-ratings-from-imdb-top-250-tv-series

##  Analysis Performed

- **Grouping by Season Counts:**
  - Created groups:
    - `5 Seasons`
    - `6 Seasons`
    - `7 Seasons`
    - `8-11 Seasons`
    - `12-41 Seasons`

- **Visualizations:**
  - **Line plots:** Season vs. Average Rating for individual shows.
  - **Grouped line plots:** Shows with similar season counts plotted together.
  - **Boxplots:** Distribution of ratings by `Episode_Group` (based on number of episodes).
  - **Histograms:** Number of seasons distribution across shows.
  - **Correlation analysis:** Between season number and rating.

## Key Insights

- TV shows often start with higher ratings in their early seasons.
- Many long-running shows (8+ seasons) show gradual decline in ratings over time.
- Shows with 5â€“7 seasons tend to maintain relatively stable ratings with mild fluctuations.
- A moderate negative correlation (~-0.5) was observed between season number and average rating for multi-season shows.
